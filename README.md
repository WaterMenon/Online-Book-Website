Book Keeping & Accounting for Library

We are trying to create a website for a library to help and ease librarians to keep track of various information about books, their respective authors, customers and the staff working in the library. Through our website, the management will find it easier to keep track of their inventory, for example about their quantity, price tags, authors, and registration dates. The website will also hold databases for their customers, staff and authors with their respective fields to make transactions and record keeping seamless and efficient.

Ours goal to create this website would consist of the following:
The homepage requires a login and register option with username and password prompts. This will help the website determine if the user is a customer, staff or admin trying to access their records.
If the user enters using the register option or using a clientâ€™s credentials; he/she would be sent to a website containing all the available stock in the library showing the names, authors, dates, ratings and the price of the books. They will be able to choose and drop to cart books of their choosing for the checkout.
Logging in using a staff credentials will take them to a new page where they will have the options to append, delete  or make changes to the following tables: Books, authors and their respective details
Logging in using the admin pass would allow the user to have all the privileges of the staff and be able to make changes to the staff database too along with having access to all the databases in the website.
Their will be four entities; Books containing (name, id, release_year, author, ratings, genre, price), a author entity with the following attributes (name, id, #books, rating), a staff entity containing the following (name, nid, password, salary, type) and a client database containing their (name, password, id, purchase_history)

The tools needed to create this project are Javascript and mySQL

Our objective of creating this project is to make bookkeeping and record tracking of libraries simpler and easier and help libraries slowly transition from paperbacks to ebooks and hopefully one day completely online making it both easier and faster for both clients and salesman to share their knowledge and imagination through the touch of a button on their fingertips.

Our goal is to create a website that will contain 3 entity databases to store information about the clients, books, staff and their authors to create a semi online bookstore to both keep track and sell books of a particular library.
